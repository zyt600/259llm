{"id": 198, "prediction": "The committee discussed the challenges in teacher recruitment, particularly in Wales. Kirsty Williams outlined that while there has been a trend of filling secondary school teacher training places at Welsh training centers, the recruitment rate for the 2018-19 cohort was only 65% of the target. She emphasized that the issue is not solely about ITE (Institute of Teaching Education) but also about the broader context of teacher recruitment, including the need for more diverse teaching staff and the importance of Welsh language skills.

Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses.

They evaluated the trade-offs between using an LCD display, which could enhance the user experience with features like scroll buttons and a menu, and the associated higher costs. The team also considered the practicality of integrating an LCD display into the remote control, including the need for a more expensive chip, and the potential for a more advanced design that could appeal to the younger market. They concluded that while an LCD display might offer better functionality, the cost implications and the need for a more expensive chip were significant factors in their", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
