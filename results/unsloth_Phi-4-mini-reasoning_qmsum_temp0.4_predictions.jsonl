The discussion also touches on the challenges of modeling complex linguistic phenomena like sarcasm, politeness, and inheritance in their formalism. The team plans to proceed by focusing on the mental space aspect and will meet again to finalize details.", "reference": "Given the domains currently used (tourist, child language learning), some features, like speaker attitude, are not of equal importance at this stage.

{"id": 188, "prediction": "The marketing expert's main concern is user identification, emphasizing that remote controls should be personalized to the user, potentially through features like color or material that match individual preferences. They believe that remote controls should be seen as personal items, akin to signatures, and suggest that incorporating trends like spongy materials or fruit/vegetable-inspired designs could enhance this personalization. The expert also stresses the importance of following trends to ensure the product is fashionable and identifiable, and they advocate for balancing trendy features with practicality to appeal to consumers' desire for both style and functionality.", "reference": "The marketing expert came up with the idea that the remote control could identify the user.

The remote will have a universal design to work with various brands and devices, and will include features like multi-functional buttons, color options, and compatibility with different platforms.
