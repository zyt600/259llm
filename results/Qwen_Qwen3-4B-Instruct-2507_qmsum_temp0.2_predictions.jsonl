They first got used to the writeboard and drew some animals with it.Project manager wanted to sell this remote control for twenty five Euro and expected profit will be around fifty million Euro. Afterwards the team raised different opinions about features of the new remote controls and related questions about market potential. Among all the features, having a good look and size were unanimously considered to be the most essential."]}
{"id": 198, "prediction": "Kirsty Williams stated that while there has been a trend of recruitment challenges in teacher training, particularly for secondary school teachers in Welsh training centres, the situation is not unique to Wales. She noted that only 65% of priority teacher training places are being filled, indicating ongoing issues. Williams attributed the problem to a combination of factors, including a global shortage of teachers, not just financial incentives, and a lack of appeal in teaching as a profession. She highlighted that international research shows similar issues in countries like the USA, Australia, and Finland. To address this, the government has taken several steps: introducing financial incentives of £20,", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

{"id": 199, "prediction": "The team discussed the use of advanced chips and LCD displays in the remote control design, with the following key points:\n\n1. **Advanced Chips**: The use of advanced chips is required if an LCD display is included. These chips are more expensive than regular chips. The team considered using a regular chip for a scroll wheel function, which is less costly than the advanced chip needed for an LCD screen.\n\n2. **LCD Display**: The inclusion of an LCD display increases the cost significantly. The team acknowledged that while an LCD display could improve usability (e.g., for scrolling through channels or volume settings), it would also make the product more expensive.", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number. But Project Manager argued that young people were less likely to have their own room to afford a LCD TV and decided not to choose the advanced ones.", "answers": ["Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
