{"id": 198, "prediction": "The committee discussed the challenges in teacher recruitment, particularly in Wales. Kirsty Williams outlined that while there has been a trend of filling secondary school teacher training places at Welsh training centers, the recruitment rate for the 2018-19 cohort was only 65% of the target. She emphasized that the issue is not solely due to financial incentives but also involves broader systemic factors. She mentioned the introduction of the part-time PGCE route to address the issue, and the need for a national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. She also highlighted the importance of supporting Welsh language skills in teacher training, including the need for a national approach to", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

{"id": 199, "prediction": "The team discussed the use of advanced chips and LCD display, considering their cost implications and the impact on the remote control's functionality and design. They evaluated the trade-offs between using an LCD display, which could enhance the user experience with features like scroll buttons and a menu, and the cost of such a display. The team also considered the potential for using a joystick instead of a scroll wheel, as it might be more user-friendly and cost-effective. They acknowledged that while an LCD display could provide a more advanced user interface, it would increase the overall cost of the remote control, which could affect its marketability. The discussion also touched on the", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number.
