{"id": 198, "prediction": "Kirsty Williams highlighted that the recruitment of teachers for secondary schools in Wales has been challenging, with only about 65% of the target places for priority subjects filled. She acknowledged that the issue is not unique to Wales and is a global concern, citing examples from the USA, UK, and other countries facing similar teacher shortages. To address this, she outlined several steps: enhancing the quality of Initial Teacher Education (ITE) provision, offering financial incentives of up to £20,000 annually for priority subject graduates, launching a national ITE recruitment campaign targeting Welsh students, and establishing an advisory board to explore recruitment and retention strategies.", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

{"id": 199, "prediction": "The team discussed the costs and benefits of using advanced chips and an LCD display in the remote control. The Industrial Designer mentioned that using an LCD display would significantly increase costs, as it would require advanced chips, which are more expensive than regular chips. The Marketing team noted that an LCD could enhance the product's appeal, potentially increasing sales despite higher costs. The Project Manager suggested considering two concepts: one with an LCD and advanced chips, and another without the LCD, using simpler chips. The team agreed that the decision would depend on the budget and the potential market appeal of the features.\nOkay, so the user wants a summary of the meeting transcript", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number. But Project Manager argued that young people were less likely to have their own room to afford a LCD TV and decided not to choose the advanced ones.", "answers": ["Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
