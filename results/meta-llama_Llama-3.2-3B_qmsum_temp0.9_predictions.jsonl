You fill it in and email it to them.\n\nOriginal Transcript: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0tmVkiHgCk (Notable gaps in English can be found in the summary)", "reference": "They want to keep the cost under 12.50 euros by controlling the materials, and they want to sell them internationally for 25 euros, with a target of 50 million euros worldwide. So they wanted the remote to be compatible with most TVS in the world, or at least all the TVS they make.", "answers": ["They want to keep the cost under 12.50 euros by controlling the materials, and they want to sell them internationally for 25 euros, with a target of 50 million euros worldwide.

{"id": 192, "prediction": "User Interface said that the icons on the buttons were interesting, both with arrows and letters that were irregular in the shapes of the buttons.", "reference": "User Interface believed that the team should design the case and the whole remote control in the company. And for colors and the logo, User Interface would recommend a yellow case, with round edges and the logo at the bottom. User Interface also suggested a set of buttons with its own color to make it recognizable. But this idea was turned down by Project Manager.", "answers": ["User Interface believed that the team should design the case and the whole remote control in the company.

{"id": 193, "prediction": "User Interface's presentation is about various methods of communication, such as writing and reading notes, and sending electronic messages. It also speaks about phone communication. It explains that, in the future, people will be able to write to each other using robots in addition to traditional methods such as electronic messages and writing. Further, the messages will be written using notes that are connected to each other in sequence, just like taking a walk along a path. The speaker describes the way such messages will flow through the receiver, causing the receiver to process each written message. Lastly, the speaker refers to how these messages can be transmitted by us humans.\n\nFinal Instructions", "reference": "User Interface talked about the method of including the buttons and the implementation of LCD screens. And he mentioned there are new developments in speech recognition systems as they are already being used on uh coffee machines; and since they're cheap, so he thinks they could use them now, as a small gimmick. As for mic and speaker, User Interface thinks that they are the same little hole things.", "answers": ["User Interface talked about the method of including the buttons and the implementation of LCD screens.

{"id": 195, "prediction": "The discussion about how to select channels was centered around two opposing views on the issue: one view advocated for the use of key buttons for channel selection, while the other view suggested the use of simple number presses or voice commands for channel selection. The former view argued that key buttons provide a more direct and intuitive way for users to select channels, while the latter view emphasized the potential benefits of using simple number presses or voice commands, such as reducing the amount of repetitive motion required to select channels and allowing users to focus on other tasks while watching television. The discussion eventually settled on a compromise: the use of a combination of key buttons and simple number", "reference": "The marketing thought it not easy to keep pressing 'next' to get to the channel people wanted. Then the user interface designer offered a solution that users could set up the channels that they often watched as one, two, and three so that they would never have to go through dozens of channels. However, in the Marketing's previous presentation, some people did love zapping, so the user interface designer suggested carrying out some research to find out how many people really needed to skip from one channel to another.", "answers": ["The marketing thought it not easy to keep pressing 'next' to get to the channel people wanted.

{"id": 196, "prediction": "Grad A proposes that he will switch on the wireless mike after the last person enters the room. Grad A also proposes that the participants read digit strings to determine whether the microphone is correctly set. Grad B proposes that Grad E read digit strings for the meeting participants. Grad E proposes that Grad B read the digits for the participants. They all propose that Grad A will provide them with more detailed instructions if the meeting transcripts are not clearly audible. Grad D proposes that he will switch on the wireless mike. Grad A provides detailed instructions on operating the microphone. Grad B confirms that Grad E will start reading digits. Grad B proposes that Grad E read digits", "reference": "A noted that all participants will have to sign a consent form and read out digits and requested that microphones be kept away from the mouth to minimize breathing sounds. A also mentioned that people will be anonymized in the transcript. A explained that the goal was to eventually be able to query meetings for information.", "answers": ["A noted that all participants will have to sign a consent form and read out digits and requested that microphones be kept away from the mouth to minimize breathing sounds.

{"id": 197, "prediction": "The whole meeting was focused on the remote control project. The meeting space was split into three parts: marketing, project manager, and industrial designer. Each person has his or her own tasks and the project manager has the final word. The marketing person gave the meeting a title, which is the first slide in the presentation, and kept track of the meeting time. The industrial designer was responsible for making the design preference decisions. The project manager was responsible for keeping the team organized and on task. The meeting ended with a helpful assistant reminding everyone when the next meeting would be.", "reference": "The meeting was mainly about the exchange of the preliminary ideas about a new TV remote control project. They first got used to the writeboard and drew some animals with it.Project manager wanted to sell this remote control for twenty five Euro and expected profit will be around fifty million Euro. Afterwards the team raised different opinions about features of the new remote controls and related questions about market potential. Among all the features, having a good look and size were unanimously considered to be the most essential.", "answers": ["The meeting was mainly about the exchange of the preliminary ideas about a new TV remote control project.

{"id": 198, "prediction": "We're now talking about cohorts of students coming intoPGCE and teaching degrees. If they're from Wales, they will have had Welsh as part of their education from day one, and we'll accept there are varying qualities in different parts of Wales, different attitudes towards it as well. But there isn't a single a person now who's been through Welsh education who can say they have no Welsh at all, unless they've moved into the systemfrom England very, very recently. What is being done within the teaching qualifications, including the degrees, to ensure that, at least in Welsh universities, those nascent Welsh language skills are at least", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

{"id": 199, "prediction": "The user interface concept has to be adapted to the chosen technology. If an LCD is used, this requires a much more expensive chip than if no LCD is used. The speaker missed the meeting in which the team decided on the technology and thus could not inform the customer. The speaker told us that it had to be a different concept because “good design doesn't start with a computer or a screen”.\n\nAnswer: No, there is no mention of how they chose the technology. The speaker mentioned that “it goes like this” in a comment, but that’s it. However, there is mention that the customer will have his say in this", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number. But Project Manager argued that young people were less likely to have their own room to afford a LCD TV and decided not to choose the advanced ones.", "answers": ["Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
