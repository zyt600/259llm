The Industrial Designer mentioned that using an LCD display would increase costs significantly, as it requires advanced chips, which are more expensive than regular or simple chips. The Project Manager noted that while an LCD display could enhance usability by showing menu options, the team needed to consider the budget constraints.

The decision hinged on cost implications and whether the added", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
