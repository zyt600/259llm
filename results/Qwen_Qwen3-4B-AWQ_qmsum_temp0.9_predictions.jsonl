She explained that the issue is not solely about financial incentives, as there are similar problems in other countries. The reasons include the need for a diverse teaching workforce, the importance of experience, and the potential of part-time PGCE routes.

Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

They considered the costs associated with these components, with the LCD display being more expensive than a regular chip. The team also explored the trade-offs between using an LCD display for a more advanced remote control and the cost implications, ultimately deciding that the budget was too low to incorporate an LCD display. Instead, they opted for a regular chip and a more basic design.\nOkay, let me see. The user is asking about what the team discussed regarding advanced chips and LCD displays.
