She emphasized that this is not a uniquely Welsh issue, noting similar teacher shortages in England, the USA, and other countries. The reasons for the difficulty in recruitment include not just financial incentives, but also broader systemic issues such as student perceptions of teaching as a profession and the lack of career pathways. To address this, the government has taken several steps: introducing financial incentives of £20,000 per year for graduates in priority subjects, launching a national recruitment marketing campaign to promote", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

These chips are more expensive than regular chips. The team acknowledged that advanced chips are required for LCD functionality, but they are costly, which raises concerns about budget constraints.\n\n2. **LCD Display**: The inclusion of an LCD display was considered to enhance usability, especially for navigating menus. However, it significantly increases the cost of the remote control. The team noted that while an LCD display could improve user experience by allowing users to see", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
