She emphasized that this issue is not unique to Wales, as teacher shortages are a global problem. The reasons for the recruitment challenges include not just financial incentives, but also broader systemic issues such as lack of confidence in teaching as a profession and the need for more diverse teaching workforce experiences. To address this, the government has taken several steps: launching a national ITE recruitment marketing campaign, increasing financial incentives for priority subjects to £20,000 per year, expanding employment-based routes into", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

{"id": 199, "prediction": "The team discussed the use of advanced chips and LCD displays in the remote control design, noting that incorporating an LCD screen would significantly increase costs due to the need for advanced chips, which are more expensive than regular chips. The Industrial Designer explained that a scroll wheel requires a regular chip (more expensive than a simple chip), while an LCD screen requires an advanced chip (even more expensive). The team acknowledged that while an LCD display could enhance usability by allowing users to see channel numbers or menu options, the added cost and complexity make it a less viable option within the current budget. They ultimately decided to explore two concepts: one with an LCD screen and", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number. But Project Manager argued that young people were less likely to have their own room to afford a LCD TV and decided not to choose the advanced ones.", "answers": ["Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
