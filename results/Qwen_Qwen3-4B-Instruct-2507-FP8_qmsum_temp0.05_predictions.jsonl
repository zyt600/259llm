She emphasized that this issue is not unique to Wales, as teacher shortages are a global concern, with similar problems in the USA, Finland, and Australia. The reasons for the recruitment difficulties include not just financial incentives, but also broader systemic issues such as student perceptions of teaching as a profession and the lack of career pathways. To address this, the government has taken several steps: introducing financial incentives of £20,000 per year for graduates in priority subjects", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

These chips are more expensive than regular chips. The team acknowledged that advanced chips are required for LCD functionality, but their cost is a significant factor in the overall budget.\n\n2. **LCD Display**: The inclusion of an LCD display was considered to enhance user experience, especially for navigating menus. However, it significantly increases the cost of the remote control.
