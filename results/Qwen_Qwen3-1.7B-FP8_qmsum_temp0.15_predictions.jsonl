The participants discussed the requirements,", "reference": "The meeting was mainly about the exchange of the preliminary ideas about a new TV remote control project. They first got used to the writeboard and drew some animals with it.Project manager wanted to sell this remote control for twenty five Euro and expected profit will be around fifty million Euro. Afterwards the team raised different opinions about features of the new remote controls and related questions about market potential. Among all the features, having a good look and size were unanimously considered to be the most essential.", "answers": ["The meeting was mainly about the exchange of the preliminary ideas about a new TV remote control project.

She mentioned that there is a trend of filling secondary school training places with non-qualified teachers, which is a concern. The Welsh Government has implemented various measures, including financial incentives, new ITE (Institute of Teaching and Education) courses, and a national recruitment marketing campaign. She also highlighted the importance of addressing the issue of language skills in Welsh-medium education and the need for a national approach to ensure that Welsh language skills are maintained among teachers. Additionally, she emphasized the importance of supporting teachers", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

They evaluated the trade-offs between using advanced chips for enhanced performance and the associated higher costs, as well as the integration of an LCD display, which could improve the user experience but would increase the overall cost. The team also considered the practicality of incorporating an LCD display into the remote control, weighing the benefits of a more advanced interface against the financial implications.\n\nThe team also discussed the use of advanced chips and LCD display, considering their costs and potential impact on the product's functionality and design.
