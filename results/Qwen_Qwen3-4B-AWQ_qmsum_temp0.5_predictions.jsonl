She identified that while financial incentives are part of the solution, they are not sufficient, as the issue is not solely about money. She emphasized the importance of a diverse teaching workforce, including career changers with varied experiences. Steps taken include enhancing ITE provision to be world-class, implementing financial incentives for priority subjects, launching a national recruitment marketing campaign, and establishing an advisory board to address recruitment and retention challenges. These measures aim to attract a broader range of candidates and ensure a more effective and diverse teaching", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

They considered the cost implications of incorporating an LCD screen, which would require more expensive advanced chips. The team also explored the trade-offs between using a scroll wheel (which requires a regular chip) and a simpler chip without a scroll wheel. They decided that an LCD display would significantly increase costs and that the current budget might not support it. The team opted for a more cost-effective solution with a regular chip and no LCD display, focusing instead on a more user-friendly design with a scroll wheel and a hand-shaped remote control.\nAnswer:\n\nThe team discussed the use", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number.
