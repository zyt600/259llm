{"id": 197, "prediction": "The meeting was a kick-off meeting for a project to design a new television remote control. The project manager, who took charge of the meeting, presented a presentation on the project's objective, scope, and timeline. The marketing team discussed their ideas for the remote control, including keeping it original, trendy, and functional. The decentralized design approach led to different iterations of the design concept. \nThe meeting also focused on the technical aspects, such as the universal compatibility of the remote control with various brands and systems, and the need for universal discreet design such as being an infrared remote. \nOverall, the meeting aimed to discuss the initial project", "reference": "The meeting was mainly about the exchange of the preliminary ideas about a new TV remote control project. They first got used to the writeboard and drew some animals with it.Project manager wanted to sell this remote control for twenty five Euro and expected profit will be around fifty million Euro. Afterwards the team raised different opinions about features of the new remote controls and related questions about market potential. Among all the features, having a good look and size were unanimously considered to be the most essential.", "answers": ["The meeting was mainly about the exchange of the preliminary ideas about a new TV remote control project.

She mentioned that the decline began in recent years and is happening across the UK. Williams stated that ITE providers require financial incentives to attract students. She also mentioned that there are reports and research suggesting that once the school gate closes, students are no longer attending Welsh-medium schools and may not know how to maintain their Welsh language skills in that context.\n\nWilliams stated that her team has established an advisory board to explore reasons behind this decline and to develop solutions to retain teachers.", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.
