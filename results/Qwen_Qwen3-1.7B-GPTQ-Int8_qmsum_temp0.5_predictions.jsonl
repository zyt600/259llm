They first got used to the writeboard and drew some animals with it.Project manager wanted to sell this remote control for twenty five Euro and expected profit will be around fifty million Euro. Afterwards the team raised different opinions about features of the new remote controls and related questions about market potential. Among all the features, having a good look and size were unanimously considered to be the most essential.", "answers": ["The meeting was mainly about the exchange of the preliminary ideas about a new TV remote control project.

{"id": 198, "prediction": "The committee discussed the trend of teacher recruitment in Wales, with concerns about the number of teachers entering the profession, especially in Welsh-medium education. Kirsty Williams outlined that the current recruitment rate is around 65% for priority places at Welsh training centers. She emphasized that while there are efforts to address the issue, such as financial incentives, new recruitment strategies, and a part-time PGCE route, the situation remains challenging. She acknowledged that teacher recruitment is a global issue, not unique to Wales, and that the Welsh Government is working on solutions, including increasing the number of Welsh-medium teachers and improving support for existing teachers.\n\nBased on this", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.
