The participants are:\n- Project Manager\n- Marketing\n- Industrial Designer\n- User Interface\n\nLet me go through the key points:\n\n1. The meeting starts with the Project Manager explaining it's a kick-off meeting where they'll meet each other, review what they already do, show tools they have (Smartboards), look at the project plan from Real Reaction, discuss first ideas about the project, and then close the meeting.\n\n2.

Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.
