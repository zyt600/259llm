They considered the cost implications of incorporating an LCD screen, which would require an advanced chip, making the remote control more expensive. Additionally, they explored the trade-off between using a scroll wheel (which requires a regular chip) and a simpler chip without a scroll wheel, affecting both the functionality and cost of the remote control. They also examined the potential benefits of an LCD display, such as enabling a scroll menu and providing visual feedback, but acknowledged the higher costs and the need to balance this with the budget constraints.
