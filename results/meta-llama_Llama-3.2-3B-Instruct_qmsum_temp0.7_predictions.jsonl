{"id": 198, "prediction": "Kirsty Williams explained that the trend of teacher recruiting in Wales was not unique to Wales, as similar issues were being experienced in other countries, including the USA, Finland, and Australia. She attributed the decline in teacher recruiting to various factors, including financial incentives, and stated that the Welsh Government was taking steps to address the issue, such as increasing the number of priority places available for teachers and providing financial incentives for teachers to enter the profession. She also mentioned that the Welsh Government was looking into other ways to attract teachers, such as employment-based routes into qualified teacher status.

Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses.

They considered the costs and usability of the remote control with an LCD display, and decided to use a normal battery and a regular chip. They also discussed the use of a joystick or scroll wheel for navigation, and decided to use a scroll wheel. The team decided to use an LCD display, but not to use the advanced chip, as it would be more expensive. They also decided to make the design more user-friendly by adding rubber around the joystick and using a hand-shaped design. \n\nIn the meeting, the Industrial Designer mentioned that the costs would be higher if", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
