{"id": 198, "prediction": "Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, stated that the recruitment trend for teachers in Wales was not a uniquely Welsh issue, but a global problem. She mentioned that the figure of 65% of priority places being filled was a target, but the actual number was lower, around 65%. She attributed the decline in recruitment to various factors, including financial incentives, ITE provision, and the lack of a clear vision for the sector. She mentioned that the Welsh Government had taken steps to address the issue, including increasing financial incentives, improving ITE provision, and promoting the benefits of teaching as a career.

The team decided to use a regular chip for the remote control, which would be cheaper. The Industrial Designer suggested using a joystick instead of a scroll wheel, which would be more user-friendly.
