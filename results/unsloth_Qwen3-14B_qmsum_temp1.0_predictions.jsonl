{"id": 198, "prediction": "Okay, let's see, I need to summarize what Kirsty Williams said about teacher recruitment trends, the reasons behind them, and the steps taken. \n\nFirst, she mentioned that for the current year, they can't provide exact figures yet, but historically they've only filled about 65% of the targets for priority subjects. So, there's a problem with recruitment. Then she talked about steps they're taking: improving the quality of Initial Teacher Education (ITE) provision, financial incentives like £20k a year for priority subjects, a national recruitment marketing campaign targeting Welsh students, and setting up an advisory board for recruitment", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

{"id": 199, "prediction": "The team discussed the use of advanced chips and LCD displays, noting that advanced chips are more expensive than regular chips and necessary for the LCD display.  They considered whether the increased cost would be justified by the added functionality and market appeal.  However, they encountered uncertainty regarding the exact cost difference compared to a simpler solution.  They also discussed the feasibility of implementing a display, noting that the television would need to support it.\nOkay, let me start by understanding the user's query. They want a summary of the meeting transcript focusing on the discussion about advanced chips and LCD displays.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the transcript to find relevant parts", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number. But Project Manager argued that young people were less likely to have their own room to afford a LCD TV and decided not to choose the advanced ones.", "answers": ["Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
