Among all the features, having a good look and size were unanimously considered to be the most essential."]}
{"id": 198, "prediction": "The committee discussed the trend of teacher recruitment, the reasons behind it, and the steps taken by the Welsh Government to address it. Kirsty Williams outlined that the Welsh Government has been working on various initiatives to improve teacher recruitment, including financial incentives, ITE (Institute of Teaching and Education) programs, and the introduction of part-time PGCE (Postgraduate Certificate in Education) courses. She emphasized that while there are challenges, the Welsh Government is committed to addressing these issues through a combination of policy changes and support for teachers. The committee also discussed the importance of diversity in the teaching workforce and the need to ensure that Welsh language skills are maintained", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

{"id": 199, "prediction": "The team discussed the use of advanced chips and LCD display, considering their cost implications and the impact on the remote control's functionality and design. They evaluated the trade-offs between using an LCD display and the associated higher costs, as well as the potential for a more user-friendly interface with scroll buttons and a menu system. The team also considered the design of the remote control, including the use of rubber for durability and the shape of the remote control to be more hand-shaped, which would make it easier to use. They also discussed the cost of the components, including the use of a normal battery versus a kinetic battery, and the importance of keeping", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number. But Project Manager argued that young people were less likely to have their own room to afford a LCD TV and decided not to choose the advanced ones.", "answers": ["Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
