{"id": 198, "prediction": "Kirsty Williams, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, discussed the ongoing challenges in teacher recruitment, particularly in the context of higher and further education. She highlighted the following:\n\n- The current recruitment rate for Welsh teacher training centers is around 65% for priority places, with a goal of increasing this to 100% by 2025.\n- She emphasized the importance of addressing the issue of teacher recruitment through a combination of financial incentives, such as the £20,000 annual financial incentive for priority subjects, and the introduction of a new part-time PGCE route for teachers who want to work in Welsh-medium", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

{"id": 199, "prediction": "The team discussed the use of advanced chips and LCD display, considering their cost implications and the impact on the design and functionality of the remote control. They evaluated the options, including the use of a normal battery, kinetic battery, and the inclusion of an LCD display. The team concluded that while an LCD display would enhance the remote control's functionality and appeal, it would significantly increase the cost. They also explored alternative solutions, such as using a scroll wheel and a joystick, to maintain functionality while keeping costs manageable. The decision to include an LCD display was made based on the potential for increased functionality and market appeal, despite the financial considerations.\nThe", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
