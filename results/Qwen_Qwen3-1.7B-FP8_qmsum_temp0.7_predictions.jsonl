Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses.

They evaluated the cost implications of using an LCD display, considering the higher costs associated with it, while also exploring alternative options such as a kinetic battery. The team discussed the benefits of an LCD display, such as a better user experience and the ability to provide a menu, but acknowledged the financial challenges it posed. They also considered the integration of a joystick as a potential alternative to a scroll wheel, which could be more cost-effective and user-friendly. The team decided to proceed with the use of a normal battery and a regular chip, acknowledging the trade", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number.
