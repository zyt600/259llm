{"id": 198, "prediction": "Kirsty Williams, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, discussed the trend of teacher recruiting in Wales. She stated that, although 65% of priority places in Welsh teacher training centers had been filled, there was still a significant job of work to be done to understand and respond to the needs of the sector. She attributed the trend to various factors, including the fact that the UK is not alone in grappling with teacher recruitment and retention issues, as evidenced by similar problems in the USA, Finland, Australia, and New York state. She also mentioned that the Welsh Government has taken steps to address the issue, including increasing the number of priority places,", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

They considered the costs and feasibility of using an LCD display, which would require an advanced chip. The team decided to use a normal battery and a regular chip, but considered using a kinetic battery as an alternative. They also discussed the design of the remote control, including the shape, size, and materials, and decided to use a joystick-like design with a curved shape and rubber coating to make it more user-friendly. The team concluded that the design should be ready for the next meeting, which is called the detailed design meeting. \n\nNote: The query is", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
