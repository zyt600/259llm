{"id": 198, "prediction": "In the meeting, Kirsty Williams, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, addressed the issue of teacher recruitment, particularly for secondary school teachers in Wales. She noted that while there has been a trend of filling places in Welsh teacher training centers, the recruitment is still below target, with only about 65% of the priority places being filled. She highlighted that this is an international issue, not unique to Wales, and that financial incentives alone are not the solution. Williams mentioned several steps being taken to address the problem, including improving the quality of Initial Teacher Education (ITE) provision, implementing a national ITE recruitment marketing campaign targeting Welsh students, and", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

{"id": 199, "prediction": "The team discussed the use of advanced chips and LCD displays in the remote control design. The Industrial Designer mentioned that using an LCD display would increase costs significantly, as it requires advanced chips, which are more expensive than regular or simple chips. The Project Manager noted that while an LCD display could make the remote more user-friendly by showing menus and channel numbers, it might not be feasible due to budget constraints. Marketing suggested that an LCD display could enhance the product's appeal and potentially justify the higher costs. However, the team agreed to explore two concepts: one with an LCD display and advanced chips, and another without, using simpler components. They also", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number.
