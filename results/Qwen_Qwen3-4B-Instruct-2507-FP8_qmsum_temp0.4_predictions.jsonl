She emphasized that this is not a uniquely Welsh problem, noting that similar teacher recruitment and retention challenges exist globally, including in the USA, Finland, and Australia. Williams attributed the issue to factors beyond financial incentives, such as the perception of teaching as a less attractive profession and the lack of strong career pathways. To address this, she outlined several steps taken or planned, including:\n\n1. Enhancing the quality of teacher training (ITE) provision to make Welsh", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

These chips are more expensive than regular chips. The team considered using a regular chip for a scroll wheel function, which is less costly than an advanced chip. Without a scroll wheel, a simple, cheaper chip can be used.\n\n2. **LCD Display**: The inclusion of an LCD display significantly increases the cost of the remote control. The team acknowledged that while an LCD display could enhance usability (e.g., showing channel numbers or", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number. But Project Manager argued that young people were less likely to have their own room to afford a LCD TV and decided not to choose the advanced ones.", "answers": ["Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
