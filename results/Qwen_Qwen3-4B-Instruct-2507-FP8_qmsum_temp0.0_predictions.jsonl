Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

These chips are more expensive than regular chips. The team acknowledged that advanced chips are necessary for LCD functionality but noted that they significantly increase the cost of the product.\n\n2. **LCD Display**: The inclusion of an LCD display was considered to enhance user experience, especially for navigating menus and viewing channel numbers.
