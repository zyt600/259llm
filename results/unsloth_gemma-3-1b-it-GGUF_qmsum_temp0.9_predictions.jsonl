It’s crucial to consider the costs within this model when assessing the effectiveness of it, which is a point we have been discussing on the committee.\n*   **The £4.50 Rate:** The key debate revolved around the proposed £4.50 hourly rate for childcare services. Huw Irranca-Davies stressed that, while the rate may seem relatively low at first glance, it's expected to be significantly reduced by increasing the number of hours families can work in order to keep their children in a place, and this would not be able to be implemented without a significant change in the structure of the offer.\n*   **Disproportionate Impact:** The committee was reminded that the affordability of the childcare offer is particularly sensitive for families with low incomes. Huw Irranca-Davies highlighted that, because some families have more difficulties in getting into work and/or making the most of their time, these families are often at risk of being excluded from opportunities when they would otherwise be able to take advantage of the scheme, and it's important we keep this in mind.\n*   **Impact on Work Patterns:** Huw Irranca-Davies noted that there is a potential for increased work patterns if people choose to increase their hours, because they are going to want to have more time for the children. The current offer would be beneficial for those who wish to improve their work patterns and/or to maximise their income through it.\n\nI hope this summary is helpful.", "reference": "Huw Irranca-Davies thought £4.50amount was an appropriate and universal amount.

In particular, they've been looking at how to make the application process clearer and easier. She added that there was a need to increase awareness of the career paths available to young people.\n\nIt is important to note that she had been asked about whether there were any plans for new recruitment targets or for more targets to be put in place by Welsh Government as a result of what she had said. As it stands at this stage, she did not mention anything specific to that.\n\nFinal Question: What was the reason for the increased number of vacancies?\nThe increase in vacancies came down to the fact that many people were moving from areas where they could get work and then had to move somewhere else because of a lack of opportunities and a lack of access to education. There were also concerns about the difficulty of recruiting teachers due to the pressures on the workforce, and the shortage of skills within the sector.\n\nFinal Question: What is the purpose of the task and finish group?\nThe main aim of this task and finish group is to deliver an approach to mental health in schools, with a focus on creating a whole-school environment. It’s about addressing student wellbeing, creating more support for those who are struggling, and ensuring that everyone has a good experience.\n\nFinal Question: What is the main reason for the increase in vacancies?\nThe primary cause of these vacancies was a combination of factors—the economic climate—a lack of opportunities in certain areas, the pressure to recruit people across a range of roles, and difficulty in providing access to education in all areas of Wales.\n\nFinal Question: What is the purpose of the task and finish group?\nThis task and finish group is designed to support Welsh schools, with an emphasis on creating a whole-school approach to mental health.
