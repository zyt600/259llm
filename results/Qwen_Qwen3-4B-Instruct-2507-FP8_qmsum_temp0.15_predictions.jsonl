The reasons for the recruitment difficulties include not just financial incentives, but also broader systemic issues such as a lack of confidence in the teaching profession and the perception that teaching is not a desirable career path. To address this, Williams outlined several steps being taken, including launching a national ITE recruitment marketing campaign, increasing financial incentives (up to £20,000 per", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

Advanced chips are required for the LCD display, which are more expensive than regular chips. The cost difference between regular and advanced chips was not clearly specified, and the team acknowledged that the advanced chip would significantly increase the overall cost of the product.\n\n2. The LCD display was considered a potential feature to enhance user experience, particularly for navigating menus and channel selection. However, the team noted that the television itself must support the menu functionality, and without an LCD, the remote control would not offer a menu interface.\n\n3.", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number. But Project Manager argued that young people were less likely to have their own room to afford a LCD TV and decided not to choose the advanced ones.", "answers": ["Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
