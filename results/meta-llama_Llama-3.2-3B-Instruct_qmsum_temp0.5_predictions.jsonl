{"id": 198, "prediction": "Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, discussed the trend of teacher recruiting in Wales, stating that they are only recruiting to about 65% of their target numbers. She attributed this to a lack of money alone, but rather a combination of factors, including the need for world-class ITE provision, financial incentives, and a lack of awareness among students about the benefits of teaching. She also mentioned that there is a global trend of teacher recruitment and retention issues, with many countries experiencing similar problems.
