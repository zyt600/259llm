She mentioned steps taken, including financial incentives for graduates, a national recruitment marketing exercise, and the establishment of an advisory board to address recruitment and retention challenges.\nAnswer: Kirsty Williams noted that while 65% of priority teacher training places are filled, challenges persist. She explained that recruitment issues are not unique to Wales, as global", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

{"id": 199, "prediction": "The team discussed the use of advanced chips and LCD displays in the remote control design. They considered the cost implications of using an LCD display, which would require an advanced chip, making it more expensive than a regular chip. They also evaluated the trade-offs between using an LCD display for enhanced functionality (like scrolling and menu navigation) versus the cost and complexity of implementing it. The team decided that the LCD display would be more expensive and that the remote control would use a regular chip if no LCD is included. They also discussed the importance of the LCD display in providing a better user experience, but acknowledged the budget constraints that might limit its inclusion.", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number. But Project Manager argued that young people were less likely to have their own room to afford a LCD TV and decided not to choose the advanced ones.", "answers": ["Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
