They first got used to the writeboard and drew some animals with it.Project manager wanted to sell this remote control for twenty five Euro and expected profit will be around fifty million Euro. Afterwards the team raised different opinions about features of the new remote controls and related questions about market potential. Among all the features, having a good look and size were unanimously considered to be the most essential.", "answers": ["The meeting was mainly about the exchange of the preliminary ideas about a new TV remote control project.

{"id": 198, "prediction": "Kirsty Williams said that the number of people applying for teacher training in Wales has been decreasing, especially in the priority subjects, and that there's a need for more support and better recruitment strategies. She also mentioned that the Welsh Government is working on improving the situation by providing financial incentives, offering part-time PGCE courses, and ensuring that Welsh language skills are maintained in teacher training.\n\nThe user has provided a detailed meeting transcript and wants a summary of what Kirsty Williams said about the trend of teacher recruiting, the reasons for it, and the steps they had taken. The summary should be concise and include the key points mentioned in the transcript.", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

{"id": 199, "prediction": "The team discussed the use of advanced chips and LCD display in the remote control design. They considered the cost implications and the impact on the user experience. The team explored different options for the remote control's interface, including scroll buttons and the use of an LCD display. They debated whether to include an LCD display, weighing the benefits of a more modern and user-friendly interface against the increased costs. The team also considered the practical aspects of using an LCD display, such as the need for a more robust battery and the potential for a more complex user interface. Ultimately, they decided to proceed with the design, keeping in mind the balance between functionality,", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number. But Project Manager argued that young people were less likely to have their own room to afford a LCD TV and decided not to choose the advanced ones.", "answers": ["Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
