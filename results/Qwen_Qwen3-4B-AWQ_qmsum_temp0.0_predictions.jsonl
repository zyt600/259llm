She explained that the issue is not solely due to a lack of financial incentives, as similar problems exist in other countries. The reasons for the difficulty in recruiting teachers include a combination of factors such as the need for a diverse teaching workforce, the importance of experience, and the challenges of retaining teachers in a competitive market. To address this, the government has implemented several steps, including enhancing the quality of teacher", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

They considered the cost implications of incorporating an LCD screen, which would require more expensive chips. The team also debated the trade-offs between using an LCD screen for enhanced functionality (like a menu system) versus the cost and complexity of implementing it. They decided that the LCD display would be too expensive for their budget and opted for a simpler design without an LCD, using regular chips instead. They also discussed the potential benefits of an LCD, such as improved user experience, but concluded that the cost and complexity made it impractical for their current project.\nAnswer: The", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
