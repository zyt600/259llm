First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses.

The decision to include an LCD display involved weighing its higher cost against its benefits, including functionality, product differentiation, and market appeal. The team explored various options, such as using a basic battery, a kinetic battery, or a regular chip. They concluded that an advanced chip, which is more expensive, would be necessary for the LCD display, but they had to balance this with budget constraints and the potential need for cost-effective alternatives.\nAnswer: \\boxed{The team discussed the use of advanced chips and LCD display,", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
