She highlighted that only about 65% of the target places for secondary school teacher training are being filled. To combat this, the Welsh Government has implemented various strategies, including improving the quality of Initial Teacher Education (ITE) provision, offering financial incentives of £20,000 annually for graduates in priority subjects, and launching a national ITE recruitment marketing campaign targeting Welsh students.

Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

The Industrial Designer mentioned that using an LCD display would increase costs significantly, as it requires advanced chips, which are more expensive than regular or simple chips. The Marketing team suggested that an LCD display could enhance the product's appeal and potentially offset the higher costs through better sales. However, the Project Manager raised concerns about compatibility with existing televisions, noting that not all TVs might support the LCD functionality. The team decided to explore two concepts: one with an LCD display and advanced chips, and another without, to evaluate cost and usability.
