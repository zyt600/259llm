They first got used to the writeboard and drew some animals with it.Project manager wanted to sell this remote control for twenty five Euro and expected profit will be around fifty million Euro. Afterwards the team raised different opinions about features of the new remote controls and related questions about market potential. Among all the features, having a good look and size were unanimously considered to be the most essential.", "answers": ["The meeting was mainly about the exchange of the preliminary ideas about a new TV remote control project.

{"id": 198, "prediction": "Kirsty Williams said that there is a trend of teacher recruiting, with 24% of places being filled by students from outside the priority areas. She stated that this is a significant problem, as it means that students from outside the priority areas are being offered places in teacher training programs, which can lead to a lack of diversity in the teaching workforce. She also mentioned that the reasons for this trend are not entirely clear, but that it may be related to the fact that students from outside the priority areas are often from lower socio-economic backgrounds, which may make them less likely to pursue a career in teaching. She stated that the steps they had", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.
