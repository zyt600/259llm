She noted that this is not unique to Wales, as similar issues are occurring in other countries, including England, the USA, Canada, and Australia. She identified that money alone is not the solution as other factors, such as a lack of interest in teaching at the younger end of the education system, are contributing. To address this, Williams introduced several measures: increased financial incentives—£20,000", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

The use of an LCD display was proposed to enhance usability, particularly for navigating menus. Industrial Designer suggested that an LCD would allow users to see channel numbers as they scroll, improving the user experience, and could be paired with a scroll wheel for intuitive navigation.\n\n2. However, the team acknowledged that adding an LCD display would significantly increase the cost of the product. Industrial Designer pointed out that the advanced chip required for the LCD display is considerably more expensive than a basic chip, which would push the product's cost beyond the", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number.
