{"id": 198, "prediction": "Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, discussed the trend of teacher recruiting in Wales. She stated that, although there was a trend of filling 65% of priority places in Welsh teacher training centers, there was still a significant job of work to be done to understand and respond to the needs of the sector. She mentioned that the Welsh Government had taken steps to improve ITE provision, including making financial incentives available to priority subjects and graduates with high qualifications. She also mentioned that the Government had embarked on a national ITE recruitment marketing exercise to target Welsh students studying for priority subject degrees. Additionally, she mentioned that the Government had set up an advisory", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

{"id": 199, "prediction": "The team discussed the use of advanced chips and LCD display in the remote control design. They considered the costs and feasibility of using an LCD display, which would require an advanced chip. The team decided to use a normal battery and a regular chip for the remote control, but considered using a kinetic battery and a simple chip as an alternative. They also discussed the design of the remote control, including the shape, size, and materials, and decided to use a pistol-like design with a joystick and a rubber coating to protect it. The team concluded that the use of an LCD display would be too expensive and not feasible for the project. \n\nNote", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number.
