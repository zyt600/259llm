She stated that, although there was a trend of filling the places for secondary school training, there was still a problem recruiting teachers into the 300 priority places. She attributed the issue to various factors, including the need for higher financial incentives to join ITE courses, but also mentioned that the problem was not unique to Wales, as similar issues were being faced in other countries, including the USA, Finland, Australia, and New York state. She also mentioned that the evaluation of Welsh-medium provision in ITE reported that there were additional people in the", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

They considered the costs and feasibility of using an LCD display, which would require an advanced chip. The team decided to use a normal battery and a regular chip, as the costs of using an LCD display would be too high. They also discussed the design of the remote control, considering the shape, size, and material, and decided to use a joystick-like design with a curved shape and a rubber coating to make it more user-friendly. The team concluded that the design should be simple, easy to use, and affordable, with a focus on selling the product", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
