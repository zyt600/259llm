{"id": 198, "prediction": "In response to Suzy Davies' questions about teacher recruitment trends, Kirsty Williams AM acknowledged that while there have been efforts to address the issue, the recruitment of teachers into the 300 priority places remains a challenge. She noted that historically, only about 65% of the target teacher training places have been filled, indicating that there is still work to be done. Williams explained that the Welsh Government is taking a multi-faceted approach, including improving the quality of Initial Teacher Education (ITE) provision, offering financial incentives for graduates in priority subjects, and launching a national ITE recruitment marketing campaign.

The Industrial Designer mentioned that using an LCD screen would significantly increase costs, as it requires more expensive chips. The Project Manager noted that an LCD would make the remote control more complex but also more user-friendly, especially with scroll buttons. However, the Marketing team expressed concerns about the cost, suggesting that a remote control without an LCD might be more marketable. The team decided to explore two concepts: one with an LCD and menu functionality, and another without, to evaluate cost and usability trade-offs. They acknowledged that the decision would depend on the budget and the", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number.
