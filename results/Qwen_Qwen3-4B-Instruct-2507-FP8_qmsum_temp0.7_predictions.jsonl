{"id": 198, "prediction": "Kirsty Williams indicated that there remains a significant challenge in recruiting secondary school teachers, with only 65% of priority places being filled in recent years. She emphasized that this is not a uniquely Welsh issue but a global concern, citing teacher shortages in England, the USA, and countries like Finland and Australia. Williams attributed the issue to a combination of factors, including the lack of financial incentives alone and a broader societal perception that teaching is not a desirable profession. To address this, the government has taken several steps: expanding financial incentives for graduates with high qualifications to £20,000 per year, launching a national recruitment marketing campaign", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

The Industrial Designer proposed that advanced chips, required for an LCD display, are significantly more expensive than regular or simple chips, with the cost increasing substantially if an LCD screen is included. The team acknowledged that while an LCD display would provide enhanced user experience and potentially improve sales by offering a menu interface, the high cost of advanced chips and the LCD screen makes it unfeasible within the current budget. As a result, the team decided to explore two concepts: one with an LCD display (which would require more expensive components", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number. But Project Manager argued that young people were less likely to have their own room to afford a LCD TV and decided not to choose the advanced ones.", "answers": ["Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
