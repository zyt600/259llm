{"id": 193, "prediction": "The transcript is a meeting where the User Interface person presented on the design of a remote control, discussing materials, colors, buttons, and other features. The presentation focused on the remote's look and feel, including materials like titanium and plastic, colors based on current trends, button placement, and the inclusion of a logo and slogan on the remote. The presentation also covered technical aspects like the use of a LCD screen, buttons, and possibly a touch pad, as well as considerations for manufacturing costs and customer preferences.", "reference": "User Interface talked about the method of including the buttons and the implementation of LCD screens. And he mentioned there are new developments in speech recognition systems as they are already being used on uh coffee machines; and since they're cheap, so he thinks they could use them now, as a small gimmick. As for mic and speaker, User Interface thinks that they are the same little hole things.", "answers": ["User Interface talked about the method of including the buttons and the implementation of LCD screens.

{"id": 195, "prediction": "The team discussed that most users only operate a few channels, typically four or five. They considered allowing users to assign functions to buttons rather than navigating through all channels. The User Interface Designer suggested a system where users could set up buttons for frequently used channels, allowing quick access without navigating through all options. They also debated the feasibility and cost of adding features like speech recognition and gesture control for channel selection.", "reference": "The marketing thought it not easy to keep pressing 'next' to get to the channel people wanted. Then the user interface designer offered a solution that users could set up the channels that they often watched as one, two, and three so that they would never have to go through dozens of channels. However, in the Marketing's previous presentation, some people did love zapping, so the user interface designer suggested carrying out some research to find out how many people really needed to skip from one channel to another.", "answers": ["The marketing thought it not easy to keep pressing 'next' to get to the channel people wanted.
