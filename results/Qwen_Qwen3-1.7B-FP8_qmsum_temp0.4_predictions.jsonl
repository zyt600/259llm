The team also discussed the importance of user experience, the need for a modern and trendy design, and the integration of the remote with other devices such as the D_V_D_ player. The meeting ended with the team agreeing on the design concepts", "reference": "The meeting was mainly about the exchange of the preliminary ideas about a new TV remote control project. They first got used to the writeboard and drew some animals with it.Project manager wanted to sell this remote control for twenty five Euro and expected profit will be around fifty million Euro. Afterwards the team raised different opinions about features of the new remote controls and related questions about market potential. Among all the features, having a good look and size were unanimously considered to be the most essential.", "answers": ["The meeting was mainly about the exchange of the preliminary ideas about a new TV remote control project.

She mentioned that the issue is not unique to Wales, as similar problems exist in England and other countries. She also outlined the steps taken to address the issue, including financial incentives, the new part-time PGCE route, and the establishment of an advisory board to study the problem.\n\nBased on the transcript, what is the correct summary of the meeting?\n\nThe correct summary is: Kirsty Williams said that the number of students in", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

{"id": 199, "prediction": "The team discussed the use of advanced chips and LCD display, considering the cost implications and the impact on the design and functionality of the remote control. They evaluated the options for the chip type, such as regular chips, simple chips, and advanced chips, and the potential cost differences. They also considered the integration of the LCD display, including its impact on the design, functionality, and overall cost of the remote control. The team decided to explore different concepts, including the use of an LCD display, and discussed the trade-offs between cost, functionality, and user experience.\nThe team discussed the use of advanced chips and LCD display, considering the cost", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number. But Project Manager argued that young people were less likely to have their own room to afford a LCD TV and decided not to choose the advanced ones.", "answers": ["Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
