The participants agreed on the basic design elements and the need for further research and development.\n\nThe meeting was a collaborative effort, with the Project Manager", "reference": "The meeting was mainly about the exchange of the preliminary ideas about a new TV remote control project. They first got used to the writeboard and drew some animals with it.Project manager wanted to sell this remote control for twenty five Euro and expected profit will be around fifty million Euro. Afterwards the team raised different opinions about features of the new remote controls and related questions about market potential. Among all the features, having a good look and size were unanimously considered to be the most essential.", "answers": ["The meeting was mainly about the exchange of the preliminary ideas about a new TV remote control project.

She mentioned that there is a significant drop in the number of people entering teacher training, especially in the Welsh language. She highlighted that the government is taking steps to address this, including financial incentives, new recruitment strategies, and the introduction of part-time PGCE programs. She also emphasized the importance of maintaining the Welsh language in education and the need for a national approach to support Welsh speakers.\n\nBased on the transcript, what is the main point of the meeting?\n\nThe main point of the meeting was to discuss the", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

{"id": 199, "prediction": "The team discussed the use of advanced chips and LCD display, considering their cost implications and the impact on the design and functionality of the remote control. They evaluated the trade-offs between using an LCD display, which could enhance the user experience and potentially increase sales, and the cost of advanced chips, which are more expensive but may offer better performance and durability. The team also considered the practicality of integrating an LCD display into the remote control, including the potential for it to be used with a scroll wheel and the associated cost increases. They concluded that while an LCD display could be beneficial, the cost was a significant factor, and they decided to proceed", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number. But Project Manager argued that young people were less likely to have their own room to afford a LCD TV and decided not to choose the advanced ones.", "answers": ["Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
