{"id": 198, "prediction": "Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, stated that there is a trend of teacher recruiting, with 65% of priority places filled in Welsh teacher training centers. She attributed the decline in recruitment to various factors, including the lack of financial incentives, and the fact that the UK is not alone in facing teacher recruitment challenges. She mentioned that the Welsh Government has taken steps to address the issue, such as increasing financial incentives, improving ITE provision, and promoting the benefits of teaching through the medium of Welsh. She also highlighted the importance of building the confidence of those who can speak Welsh and are not teaching through the medium. Williams emphasized that the", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

{"id": 199, "prediction": "The team discussed the use of advanced chips and LCD display in the remote control design. They considered the costs and feasibility of using an LCD display, which would require an advanced chip. The Industrial Designer suggested using a regular chip instead, which would be cheaper. The Project Manager agreed that the LCD display would be more expensive, but still considered it a good option. The team ultimately decided to use a regular chip and keep the design simple, with no LCD display. \n\nNote: The query is not explicitly stated in the transcript, but it can be inferred from the discussion about the use of advanced chips and LCD display. \n\nPlease let me know", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number.
