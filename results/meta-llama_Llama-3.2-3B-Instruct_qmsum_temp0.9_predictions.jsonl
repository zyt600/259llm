{"id": 198, "prediction": "Kirsty Williams stated that the trend of 65% of priority places being filled in Welsh teacher training centers was below the target, and they were working to address the issue. She mentioned that the main reason for the decline was not just financial incentives, but a broader issue with attracting and retaining teachers. She said that the problem was not unique to Wales, but a global issue, and that higher education systems around the world were facing similar challenges. She also mentioned that the main issue was not the amount of money offered, but the perception that teaching was not a viable career option. She said that there were many factors contributing to the issue,", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

They considered two options: using an LCD display with a regular chip or using an LCD display with an advanced chip. If they use the regular chip, they would keep the cost down, but if they use the advanced chip, they would have to use a more expensive chip. The team decided that they would use a normal battery, regular chip, and LCD display. They also discussed the shape of the remote control, considering a pistol-shaped design with rubber around it to protect it. The team agreed that the design should be small and curved, with a joystick-like", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
