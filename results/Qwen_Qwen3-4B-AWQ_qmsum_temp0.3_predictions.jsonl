She highlighted that while there is a trend of difficulty in recruitment, it is not unique to Wales, as similar issues exist globally. She mentioned that financial incentives, such as £20,000 per year for priority subjects, are part of the solution, along with a national recruitment marketing campaign targeting Welsh students. Additionally, she emphasized the importance of addressing the root causes, such as the need for a more diverse teaching workforce and the importance of retaining teachers through alternative routes like part", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

They considered the cost implications of incorporating an LCD screen, which would require more expensive chips. The team also debated the trade-offs between using an LCD for enhanced functionality (like a menu system) versus the cost and complexity of implementing it. They decided to explore both options, with the LCD option being more expensive but potentially offering better user experience, while the non-LCD option was more cost-effective but simpler.\nThe summary should be in one paragraph, 2-3 sentences, and in the same language as the query (English).\nAnswer:\nThe team discussed", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
