{"id": 198, "prediction": "Kirsty Williams, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, discussed the trend of teacher recruiting in Wales. She stated that, although the Welsh Government had set targets for teacher recruitment, the actual number of teachers recruited was only around 65% of the target. She attributed this to various factors, including the fact that the UK is facing a global teacher recruitment crisis, and that the Welsh Government is not the only one struggling to recruit teachers. She mentioned that the UK's Office for Students (OfS) has reported a 40% drop in the number of students training to be teachers in the USA, and that similar issues are being faced in other", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

{"id": 199, "prediction": "The team discussed the use of advanced chips and LCD display in the remote control. They considered the costs and feasibility of using an LCD display, which would require an advanced chip. The team decided that using an LCD display would be too expensive and instead opted for a simpler design with a regular chip. They also discussed the use of a joystick or scroll wheel, and decided that a joystick would be a good option, but would require a more expensive chip. The team agreed that the design should be simple, easy to use, and affordable, and that the LCD display would not be feasible due to the high cost. \n\nNote: The query is", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number.
