{"id": 198, "prediction": "In the meeting, Kirsty Williams, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, discussed the trend in teacher recruitment, particularly for secondary school teachers. She noted that while there has been a trend of filling places in recent years, there is still a significant challenge in recruiting teachers to meet the 300 priority places. She highlighted that only about 65% of the target places are currently filled. To address this, several steps have been taken, including improving the quality of Initial Teacher Education (ITE) provision, offering financial incentives of £20,000 per year for priority subjects, and launching a national ITE recruitment marketing campaign targeting", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

{"id": 199, "prediction": "The team discussed the use of advanced chips and LCD displays in the remote control design. The Industrial Designer mentioned that using an LCD screen would require advanced chips, which significantly increase the cost. The Marketing team argued that an LCD would make the product more appealing and potentially increase sales, despite the higher costs. The Project Manager acknowledged the cost concerns but noted that the LCD could enhance usability, especially with scroll buttons. They decided to explore two concepts: one with an LCD and advanced chips, and another without, to evaluate cost and functionality trade-offs. The team agreed to further investigate the cost differences and finalize the decision in the next meeting.\nOkay,", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number. But Project Manager argued that young people were less likely to have their own room to afford a LCD TV and decided not to choose the advanced ones.", "answers": ["Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
