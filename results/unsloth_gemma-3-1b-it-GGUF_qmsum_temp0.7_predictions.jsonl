They came up with steps to address these challenges, including promoting career development opportunities, increasing flexibility in working arrangements, and creating mentorship schemes.\n\nEluned Morgan AM: So, I'd like to add some points here. The trend has been growing for some time, and it’s driven by a number of factors. Firstly, there's an increasing desire for diversity among teaching roles. There's a need for specialist skills, and with the current pressures on staffing, there is an opportunity for those who are able to do more work or have more experience to get on and get their careers moving forward. Secondly, there has been a greater emphasis on the need for experienced teachers in areas where there is little demand. There’s been a shift of staff from rural to urban areas and some of the challenges that these students face are increasing in terms of the cost of living. The committee also discussed how difficult it can be to attract young people to teaching roles, particularly those who are seeking more flexibility.\n\nHefin David AM: I agree with that, as well. I think this is a really important point—we need to think about what’s happening in the sector. This is not just an issue of supply and demand; it’s a reflection of the challenges faced by the individuals who are seeking to enter teaching. The lack of opportunities—the lack of flexibility—and the pressure on teachers means that people are looking for more options, and they're increasingly considering alternative career paths.\n\nLynne Neagle AM: So, let’s look at the steps taken, as you mentioned. The committee has been actively working to address these challenges. They’ve been implementing mentorship schemes—which is a fantastic step. And there are efforts being made to increase flexibility in working arrangements and to offer more support for teachers facing personal or family difficulties.\n\nDawn Bowden AM: I can confirm that, there has been the implementation of a mentorship program, where experienced teachers mentor new teachers.

In fact, there's an estimated 30% increase in student debt since 2019. The government has implemented several programs and initiatives to help students navigate this difficult time. Those include direct payment programs, expanded loan forgiveness, and increased eligibility requirements for student loans. We are working with provincial governments to expand these measures.\n\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet-Joncas: Mr. Chair, I'm concerned about the burden of student debt on young Canadians. It has become a significant barrier to their ability to build a secure future. It’s important for students to be able to pursue their education and find employment. This program is important for Canadian society and it will not hurt anyone.\n\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: In this matter, I want to bring forward the fact that we have increased student loan payments, but they are also significantly higher than the previous years. We need to focus on helping people build a stable future through education.

First, there's a reduction in available resources which will affect the ability to fund research, staff and student support, and infrastructure investment. Second, some university sectors have been left with less flexibility to move forward with strategic priorities. Third, the loss of funding can create pressure on universities to manage costs more closely, and this may lead to difficult decisions about where to allocate resources. The EU’s financial contributions are not a guarantee for continued funding, but it is essential that we do what we can to maintain the stability of the system and ensure access to EU-funded research.\nBethan Owen: So, one possible solution would be to explore alternative funding sources within the UK and internationally.
