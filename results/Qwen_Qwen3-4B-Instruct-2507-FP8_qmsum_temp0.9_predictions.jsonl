{"id": 198, "prediction": "Kirsty Williams stated that there is still a significant challenge in recruiting teachers into Welsh teacher training centres, with only 65% of priority places filled in recent years. She emphasized that this issue is not unique to Wales but is a global concern, evident in countries like the USA, England, and Finland, as well as in the UK's own education systems. Williams identified that financial incentives alone are not the complete solution, as cultural and systemic issues also play a role. To address this, the Welsh Government has launched a multi-faceted strategy, including a new national ITE recruitment marketing campaign to promote teaching as a vital profession, enhanced", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

They acknowledged that incorporating an LCD display would significantly increase costs due to the need for advanced chips, making it less feasible within the current budget. While the LCD display could enhance user experience by providing a menu interface, the team concluded that the added expense and complexity are not justified, especially because the television itself must support the menu functionality. As a result, they decided to proceed with a design that excludes the LCD display and instead focus on simpler, more cost-effective features like a scroll button and a regular chip.

But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number.
