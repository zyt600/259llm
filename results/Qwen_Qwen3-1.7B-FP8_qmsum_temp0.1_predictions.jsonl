They first got used to the writeboard and drew some animals with it.Project manager wanted to sell this remote control for twenty five Euro and expected profit will be around fifty million Euro. Afterwards the team raised different opinions about features of the new remote controls and related questions about market potential. Among all the features, having a good look and size were unanimously considered to be the most essential.", "answers": ["The meeting was mainly about the exchange of the preliminary ideas about a new TV remote control project.

She mentioned that there is a significant drop in the number of people entering teacher training, especially in the Welsh language. She highlighted that the government is taking steps to improve the situation, including financial incentives, new recruitment strategies, and a focus on the importance of Welsh language skills in education. She also emphasized the need for a more comprehensive approach that includes both financial support and the development of the teaching workforce.\n\nBased on the transcript, what is the correct summary of the meeting? The answer should be in the form", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

The team evaluated the trade-offs between using an LCD display, which could enhance the user experience and potentially increase sales, and the associated higher costs. They also considered the practicality of integrating the LCD display into the remote control, including the impact on the remote's size, shape, and overall design. The discussion included the possibility of using a joystick instead of a scroll wheel, which could offer a more intuitive user experience while balancing cost considerations. The team also explored the use of different materials and shapes for the remote", "reference": "Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number. But Project Manager argued that young people were less likely to have their own room to afford a LCD TV and decided not to choose the advanced ones.", "answers": ["Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
