There's been a trend in recent years to fill those places, which, she said, is at Welsh teacher training centers. She acknowledged that this is at the heart of the current situation, given the significant drop in numbers of students going into teacher training. She also mentioned that there have been some excellent programs, such as the one from Cardiff Metropolitan University, that have shown that it is possible to train teachers effectively and that they can be successful in the field.\n\nSummary: Kirsty Williams said that the reasons for this trend include financial incentives, selective recruitment, and", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.
