Lynne Neagle AM welcomes Huw Irranca-Davies, Minister for Children and Social Care, Jo-Anne Daniels, director for communities and tackling poverty, and Owain Lloyd, deputy director for childcare, play and early years. Hefin David raises questions about the administrative burden of implementing the offer in pilot areas due to complex eligibility criteria requiring parents to provide wage slips and birth certificates. Huw Irranca-Davies explains that each pilot area handles this bureaucracy differently, with some entire authorities involved. The main challenge is communication as parents outside these areas ask why they don't qualify. Hefin also asks about add-ons like better care for wealthier families in the same setting. Huw responds by saying they're not creating a race to the bottom but rather building on existing models of childcare within communities, such as grandparents providing informal care. The Welsh Government prefers expanding pilot areas gradually due to lessons learned from other regions and complexity of family situations. Hefin also questions if they should offer subsidies for grandparent caregivers. Huw says it's more about cultural differences than financial incentives. David asks about the impact on capacity given comments that Wales has a fragile childcare sector. Huw disagrees, stating they're making it resilient through investment in facilities and workforce development. The Welsh Government is learning from pilot rollouts to ensure appropriate rates across regions with varying costs. They are confident of meeting demand by 2020 due to careful expansion based on lessons learned. David also questions the £4.50 rate's future affordability given rising living costs, but Huw assures it's been widely accepted and will be reassessed as needed. Mark Reckless asks about integrating Welsh-medium childcare into mainstream provision. Huw mentions investing in meithrin (Welsh-language childcare) to meet demand. Darren raises concerns about the impact of increasing National Living Wage on affordability. Huw acknowledges monitoring this but remains confident due to lessons from pilot rollouts and phased implementation. John questions if disadvantaged families are excluded, especially those not eligible for schemes like Flying Start. Huw emphasizes that it's part of a broader strategy supporting working parents through various initiatives. Lynne wraps up the session with final remarks on child development and strategic alignment with Welsh Government priorities.\n\nAnswer:\nThe intensity of demand in early implementer areas is concentrated due to lessons learned from pilot rollouts, which revealed complex family situations requiring tailored approaches across regions.

Marketing raised concern about remote not being fashionable enough compared to trends but UI defended color choice.\n\nProject Manager led criteria evaluation: 7-point scale on tech innovation, target market (young), product look, number of buttons, fashion statement, durability, and trend alignment. Disagreements resolved with average ratings mostly low for design appeal vs high for technology features. Finance discussed cost at €13 after removing joystick to save €1 (€15 base minus adjustments). Debate over color: yellow was defended as trendy despite not being fashionable; agreed on standardizing button colors.\n\nFinal evaluation highlighted teamwork and innovation, concluding prototype ready for finance review with adjusted price and design tweaks.", "reference": "Firstly, User Interface introduced the prototype of remote control based on the previous discussion of its function. The prototype was half rubber and half plastic with a yellow case. Secondly, Marketing designed an evaluation test under the guidance of the market trend as well as the customers' taste and the team gave one to seven points to each feature of the product.Thirdly, the team found that the current product exceeded the budget, so the team decided to discard joystick and use only one material with the normal color but the team agreed to keep the LCD as well as the advanced chips.

So I need to find all parts where she talks about this topic.\n\nLooking at the transcript:\n\nSuzy Davies AM asks: \"Is there something running through our younger learners at the moment that makes them think teaching isn't a profession they want to go into?\"\n\nKirsty Williams says: No. She thinks it's not uniquely Welsh issue, and there's acute problem across border. Despite higher financial incentives in England, they're still low enrollment.\n\nShe mentions setting up an advisory board chaired by Professor John Gardner to understand issues preventing people from entering teacher training.\n\nThen later:\n\nSuzy Davies asks about why this is unattractive despite policy for improving Welsh speakers among teachers.\n\nKirsty says data on recruitment shows difference between those on courses with specific designations and others. They have 130 more qualifiers in Wales who are fluent but didn't do a course to teach them. She mentions the evaluation report published, new incentives added: £20k/year plus financial incentives for first-year teachers after completing QTS.\n\nAlso:\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders asks about funding cuts affecting part-time provision and whether they will undermine Diamond reforms.\n\nKirsty says they've done unique support for full-time students in Wales. Part of the answer is that it's too early to have definitive figures, but initial signs show increased demand due to Diamond reforms.\n\nShe mentions fee & access plans from universities being reviewed by HEFCW to ensure promoting equality.\n\nAlso:\n\nMichelle Brown asks about data and analysis used by universities on their access plans.\n\nHuw Morris says there's HESA data collected across UK. They supplement with WISERD for additional breakdowns.\n\nKirsty agrees but notes the challenge of accessing HESA data in future due to OfS changes.\n\nSo, compiling all this:\n\n- Kirsty Williams addressed teacher recruitment trends by stating it's not unique to Wales and similar issues exist globally (e.g., USA saw 40% drop). Despite higher financial incentives (£20k/year), uptake isn't sufficient because the issue is complex. Steps taken include setting up an advisory board chaired by Professor John Gardner, reviewing fee & access plans under HEW Act, introducing new recruitment marketing for Welsh students, and implementing Diamond reforms to support trainees financially.\n\n- She emphasized that data shows a difference between those on courses with specific designations (like teaching through Welsh) versus others. They plan to use evaluation reports to improve training providers' offerings in language skills.\n\n- For part-time provision under funding cuts: she assured no concerns as students drive demand, and reforms are ongoing without immediate impact due to early data collection.\n\nSo the summary should include these points concisely.\n</think>\n\n**Summary of Kirsty Williams' Statements on Teacher Recruitment Trends, Causes, and Steps Taken**\n\n1. **Trend in Teacher Recruitment**:\n   - Kirsty Williams acknowledged a \"job of work\" remains but emphasized teacher recruitment challenges are global (e.g., USA saw a 40% drop). Despite higher financial incentives (£20k/year for new teachers), uptake is insufficient due to complex factors beyond monetary rewards.\n\n2. **Causes of Low Recruitment**:\n   - She highlighted that the issue isn't unique to Wales, referencing similar trends in other countries. Financial incentives alone aren't enough because broader systemic issues persist.\n   - Acknowledged acute recruitment challenges across England and globally (e.g., USA), indicating this is a widespread concern.\n\n3. **Steps Taken**:\n   - Established an advisory board chaired by Professor John Gardner to address recruitment barriers, focusing on non-monetary factors like work-based routes into teaching.\n   - Implemented the \"Diamond reforms,\" providing financial support for trainees through grants and loans, aiming to reduce economic disincentives.\n   - Laid out plans to improve teacher training quality via accreditation processes and new incentives (e.g., £20k/year stipend) for first-year teachers post-QTS completion.\n   - Reviewed universities' fee & access plans under the Higher Education Wales Act 2015 to ensure alignment with equality goals, supplementing HESA data with additional research tools like WISERD.\n\n**Key Points**:\n- **Global Context**: Recruitment challenges are not isolated to Wales but reflect broader systemic issues affecting education systems worldwide.\n- **Complex Solutions**: Steps include advisory boards, financial reforms (Diamond), and collaboration with providers to enhance training quality and inclusivity.\n- **Data-Driven Adjustments**: Ongoing analysis of recruitment trends and provider performance informs policy tweaks, emphasizing non-monetary support alongside economic incentives.\n\nThis summary encapsulates Kirsty Williams' responses to committee questions about teacher recruitment challenges, underlying causes, and the multi-faceted strategies employed to address them.", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.
