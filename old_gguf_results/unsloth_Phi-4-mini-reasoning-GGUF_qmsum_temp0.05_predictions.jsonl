Hefin David raises questions about the administrative burden of implementing the offer in pilot areas due to complex eligibility criteria requiring parents to provide wage slips and birth certificates. Huw Irranca-Davies explains that each pilot area handles this bureaucracy differently, with some entire authorities involved. The main challenge is communication as parents outside these areas ask why they don't qualify. Hefin questions about capacity issues but the Minister says it's not a problem due to lessons learned from other regions.\n\nJo-Anne Daniels supports Huw's points and adds that cultural factors also play a role in uptake, such as reliance on informal childcare within families. She mentions learning alongside providers and parents about communication challenges.\n\nHefin David asks if subsidies for grandparents providing care could be considered given their existing roles. Jo-Anne clarifies the scheme is not intended to replace family care but provide an alternative option with registered providers who may also look after their own grandchildren in a small group.\n\nDarren Millar questions the £4.50 rate's adequacy considering rising living costs and compares it unfavorably to other regions. Huw Irranca-Davies defends the rate as suitable given lessons from pilot areas, emphasizing simplicity over complexity compared to England's system. He mentions expanding the offer across more areas with careful rollouts.\n\nJohn Griffiths asks about workforce capacity for childcare providers due to high costs in certain areas and whether different rates could be considered. Huw Irranca-Davies stresses learning from pilots before making changes but remains confident in meeting demand through strategic planning and partnerships.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd questions the impact of research suggesting no significant effects on income or work behavior, countering with real-life pilot evidence showing increased employment opportunities for parents due to childcare availability. Huw Irranca-Davies agrees that ongoing evaluation is part of their process but highlights positive outcomes from early pilots.\n\nMark Reckless asks about aligning child development goals with the £4.50 rate and whether it might pressure providers into lower quality care. Jo-Anne Daniels stresses focusing on qualified staff in registered settings to ensure high-quality childcare, which aligns with educational components of the offer.\n\nThe intensity of demand is not spread evenly due to economic factors like regional cost differences (e.g., higher costs in Cardiff vs Blaenau Gwent) and cultural practices affecting uptake.

So I need to find all parts where she talks about this topic.\n\nLooking at the transcript:\n\nSuzy Davies AM asks: \"Is there something running through our younger learners at the moment that makes them think teaching isn't a profession they want to go into?\"\n\nKirsty Williams says: No. She thinks it's not uniquely Welsh issue, and there's acute problem across border. Despite higher financial incentives in England, they're still low enrollment.\n\nShe mentions setting up an advisory board chaired by Professor John Gardner to understand issues preventing people from entering teacher training.\n\nThen later:\n\nSuzy Davies asks about why this is unattractive despite policy for improving Welsh speakers among teachers.\n\nKirsty says data on recruitment shows difference between those on courses with specific designations and others. They have 130 more qualifiers in Wales who are fluent but didn't do a course to teach them. She mentions the evaluation report published, new incentives added: £20k/year plus financial incentives for first-year teachers after one year.\n\nAlso:\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders asks about funding cuts affecting part-time provision and whether it undermines Diamond reforms.\n\nKirsty says HE sector has parity of support between full/part time.

Despite higher financial incentives in Wales compared to England, enrollment remains low due to factors beyond money alone. She emphasized the need for a multi-faceted approach including improving initial training experiences (ITI), creating flexible routes like part-time PGCE, and addressing broader systemic issues through evaluations and reforms aimed at understanding barriers and enhancing support mechanisms.\n\nSteps taken include:\n\n- Setting up an advisory board chaired by Professor John Gardner to explore recruitment challenges.\n- Increasing qualified teacher places for on-the-job training providers.\n- Introducing new financial incentives (£20k/year) and additional funding for first-year teachers after a year of service.\n- Implementing the evaluation report's recommendations, including minimum Welsh language skill provisions in ITE courses.\n- Developing alternative routes like part-time PGCE to accommodate diverse student needs.\n\nThis covers her statements on teacher recruitment trends, reasons behind them (beyond financial incentives), and steps taken by the Welsh Government to address these issues. The summary should highlight that it's a complex issue requiring multiple strategies beyond just funding adjustments, including systemic reforms and support for alternative training pathways.\n</think>\n\n**Summary:**\n\nKirsty Williams addressed concerns about teacher recruitment trends, emphasizing they are not unique to Wales but part of a global challenge affecting education systems worldwide. Despite higher financial incentives in Wales compared to England, enrollment remains low due to factors beyond monetary compensation. She highlighted the following key points and steps taken:\n\n1. **Global Context**: Teacher shortages span countries like Finland, USA, and Australia, indicating systemic issues rather than isolated Welsh problems.\n\n2. **Non-Monetary Factors**: Challenges include cultural perceptions of teaching, balancing work/caring responsibilities, and inadequate career progression for non-traditional candidates (e.g., mature students).\n\n3. **Advisory Board Initiative**: Established an advisory board chaired by Professor John Gardner to analyze barriers to teacher recruitment and retention.\n\n4. **Reforms in Teacher Training**:\n   - Increased qualified-teacher placements for on-the-job training.\n   - Introduced new financial incentives (£20,000/year) and support for first-year teachers post-QTS (Qualifying Teacher Status).\n   - Launched a national ITE provider accreditation process to ensure alignment with curriculum goals.\n\n5. **Alternative Routes**: Developed part-time PGCE programs to accommodate diverse student needs, promoting inclusivity for those balancing employment or caregiving responsibilities.\n\n6. **Evaluation and Data-Driven Action**: Implemented recommendations from an evaluation report on Welsh-medium teaching provision, focusing on tracking outcomes and improving support mechanisms across education sectors.\n\nWilliams stressed that teacher recruitment requires a multifaceted approach beyond funding adjustments, involving systemic reforms to enhance training experiences, inclusivity, and strategic partnerships between institutions. The steps reflect ongoing efforts to understand barriers, improve accessibility, and align policies with global best practices.", "reference": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.
