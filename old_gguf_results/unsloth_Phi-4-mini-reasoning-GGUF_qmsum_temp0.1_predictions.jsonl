The question specifically asks how Kirsty Williams responded to university mergers.\n\nFrom the relevant part of the transcript:\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Can I just pick up on that? I mean, there are 10 universities in Wales now. Is the Welsh Government in favour of more university mergers?\n\nKirsty Williams AM: I wouldn't use the word 'agnostic', but what I'm in favour of is a healthy, strong and sustainable HE sector. If individual institutions wish to collaborate or, indeed, go further to a formal merger then, obviously, that is a matter for them.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: But HEFCW are pushing it.\n\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, again, what HEFCW are interested in is a sustainable HE sector but, as I said, I'm not pursuing or urging a policy of mergers, but if individual institutions feel that there is an advantage—I would hope for the student first, and, if we put the student at the front of this process, then we would obviously have an interest in that and making sure that that was the right thing to do.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: But I think it's a cataclysmic drop, really. We've lost 24 per cent in the number of people over the last four or five years who are coming into teacher training to study subjects that they could teach through the medium of Welsh. So, there's a huge turnaround that we're looking for, and I'm not getting the feeling that the level of ambition and the answers that you're giving here this morning reflect the level of action that's needed, really.\n\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, first of all, as I tried to illustrate to Suzy Davies, the figures on their own tell one story, but there are additional people in the system with an ability to speak Welsh and to be able to use those language skills positively in school settings. So, that doesn't tell us the whole story, but I will be the first to admit that there is a significant job of work with our ITE providers to ensure that we'll have the skilled professionals that we need to deliver on our ambitions, and I'm not hiding from that.\n\nSummary: Kirsty Williams responded by stating her preference for a healthy, strong, and sustainable higher education sector. She acknowledged mergers as a possibility but emphasized it was up to individual institutions rather than the government to decide. She did not actively promote or discourage mergers, instead focusing on ensuring collaboration between providers if beneficial for students. Her response highlighted existing initiatives like the ITE reforms while acknowledging ongoing work with providers to meet targets and improve outcomes.\n\nAnswer:\n\nKirsty Williams responded by stating her preference for a healthy, strong, and sustainable higher education sector.

The committee discussed various aspects of the pandemic, including long-term care facilities.\n\nThe question was about reports on long-term care facilities. Members asked questions related to these reports and what actions were being taken in response.\n\nIn this case, we need to summarize the questioning about the reports on long-term care facilities based on the given query.\n\nSo, the summary should focus specifically on the parts of the transcript where members questioned about the reports on long-term care facilities. This includes questions from Ms. Sidhu, Mr. Singh, Mrs. McLeod, and others regarding the contents of the report, what actions were being taken in response, who was responsible for investigating the issues raised in the report, etc.\n\nThe summary should highlight key points such as:\n\n- The report detailed poor conditions in long-term care facilities.\n- Members asked about federal responsibility and action plans to prevent further incidents.\n- Questions focused on investigation into potential negligence or abuse mentioned in the report.\n- Ministers provided responses regarding ongoing investigations by provinces/territories, existing regulations, and federal support measures.\n\nThe summary should be concise and directly address the questions related to the reports on long-term care facilities.\n\nI'll make sure to include specific examples of questions asked about the reports and how ministers responded. Also, note any key themes or issues that emerged from these interactions, such as accountability, jurisdictional challenges, and federal support mechanisms.\n\nFinally, I'll ensure the summary is clear and directly answers the query by focusing on the questioning related to the long-term care facility reports.\n</think>\n\n**Summary of Questioning About Reports on Long-Term Care Facilities:**\n\nDuring the meeting, members focused on a detailed report from the Canadian Armed Forces documenting poor conditions in Ontario’s long-term care homes. Key questions included:\n\n1. **Prevention and Accountability:**  \n   - Members asked how the federal government would prevent further tragedies after reviewing the report (e.g., Mrs. Sidhu). Ministers emphasized provincial responsibility but noted federal readiness to support reforms.\n\n2. **Investigation into Alleged Negligence or Abuse:**  \n   - Mr. Singh questioned whether the federal government would refer cases of potential criminal conduct to police (as per the military report) and demanded clarity on investigation processes, which were deferred to provinces/territories.\n\n3. **Regulatory Oversight and Standards:**  \n   - Mrs. McLeod criticized lax standards compared to hospitals and pushed for national legislation akin to the Canada Health Act. Ministers stressed provincial jurisdiction over care homes but acknowledged federal investments in home-based aged care.\n\n4. **For-Profit Care Criticism:**  \n   - Ms. Kwan condemned profit-driven facilities highlighted in the report, questioning why federal funds weren’t redirected from failing models. Responses emphasized existing regulations and partnerships with provinces to improve standards.\n\n5. **Federal vs. Provincial Roles:**  \n   - Mrs. Gill challenged ministers on perceived misallocation of emergency aid toward political entities rather than sectors like tourism/fisheries affected by care home failures. Ministers reiterated consistent federal criteria for all workers, not specific industries.\n\n6. **Supply Chain and PPE Shortages:**  \n   - Ms. Jansen raised concerns about declining mask orders amid global shortages. Officials explained competitive supply challenges but assured multi-contractual efforts to secure critical supplies.\n\n**Key Themes:**\n- Accountability gaps between federal/ provincial jurisdictions.\n- Urgent need for systemic care home reforms.\n- Transparency in addressing financial and operational failures.\n- Balancing immediate PPE/economic aid with long-term structural changes.\n\nThis questioning underscored deep distrust in existing oversight mechanisms and a push for clearer, swifter action to protect seniors from preventable harm.", "reference": "The opposition party questioned that the report was delayed in issuing by the government and was not acted upon.

{"id": 198, "prediction": "The user wants a summary of what Kirsty Williams said about the trend in teacher recruitment, why it's happening, and the steps taken. Let's break down the relevant parts from her answers.\n\nFirst question: Suzy Davies asks about teacher training trends, especially for secondary school teachers.\n\nKirsty Williams says that they are only recruiting to about 65% of targets. She mentions financial incentives (£20k/year) but says it's not the whole answer. They have a national ITE recruitment marketing exercise targeting Welsh students in priority subjects. Also, they're setting up an advisory board on teacher recruitment and retention chaired by Professor John Gardner. Other steps include increasing employment-based routes (like job training while working), new part-time PGCE route to combine work/life balance.\n\nSecond question: Eluned asks about why teaching isn't more attractive given a policy to improve Welsh speakers in schools.\n\nKirsty says it's not unique to Wales, other countries have similar issues. They increased financial incentives but still aren't enough because non-financial factors matter too. She mentions the difference between those on courses with specific designations vs. those just fluent in Welsh. Also talks about promoting career changers into teaching and diversifying teacher workforce.\n\nThird question: Llyr asks why they need to double numbers by 2021 given a drop of 24% over years.\n\nKirsty says stats are complex; current trends show some areas increasing while others decrease. Emphasizes the evaluation report published, which gives recommendations on improving Welsh language skills in training through minimum provisions and collaboration with ITE providers.\n\nSo combining all this: The key points are:\n\n- Recruitment is below target (65% of priority places filled).\n- Reasons include global issue affecting multiple countries; not just financial.\n- Steps taken: Financial incentives, marketing to students, advisory board on retention, expanding employment-based training routes, new part-time PGCE route.\n\nNow, the answer should be concise and cover these points clearly. Let's make sure it's accurate based on her answers.\n</think>\n\n**Summary of Kirsty Williams' Responses:**\n\n1. **Teacher Recruitment Trends:**  \n   - Welsh teacher training centres are only filling ~65% of priority places for 2018-19 intake.  \n   - This indicates ongoing challenges in meeting recruitment targets.\n\n2. **Reasons Behind Low Attraction to Teaching:**  \n   - A global issue, not unique to Wales; acute shortages exist across education systems (e.g., USA).  \n   - Financial incentives alone are insufficient—non-monetary factors like work-life balance and career flexibility matter more.  \n\n3. **Steps Taken to Address Recruitment Challenges:**  \n   - Increased financial incentives (£20k/year for priority subjects) but emphasized it’s not the sole solution.  \n   - Launched a national ITE recruitment marketing campaign targeting Welsh students in STEM/priority fields.  \n   - Established an advisory board (chaired by Professor John Gardner) to evaluate teacher retention strategies.  \n   - Expanded employment-based training routes and introduced a new part-time PGCE option to accommodate diverse student needs.  \n\n**Key Takeaways:**  \n- Recruitment falls short of targets due to complex, systemic issues beyond financial incentives.  \n- The Welsh Government is actively addressing this through multi-faceted reforms (e.g., marketing campaigns, advisory boards, diversified training routes).  \n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Kirsty Williams acknowledged low recruitment rates at 65% capacity for priority places.
